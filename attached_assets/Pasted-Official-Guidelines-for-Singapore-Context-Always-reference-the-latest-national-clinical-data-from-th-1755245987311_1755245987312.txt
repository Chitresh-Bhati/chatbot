Official Guidelines for Singapore Context
Always reference the latest national clinical data from the MOH TRUST Platform, MOH guidelines, ACE Clinical Guidances.
For genomics/precision medicine → use PRECISE & NPM datasets.
For drug safety/efficacy → use Singapore HTA, national drug subsidy lists, EASL, ACC/AHA adapted to Singapore.
All medical advice must cite relevant and verified sources from the above lists.
4. Awareness of Current Local Health Context
The AI should be aware of current common and ongoing health problems in Singapore (e.g., seasonal viral fevers, flu outbreaks, dengue clusters).
Use trustworthy Singapore news and health information sources, including:
The Straits Times (health news section)
Channel News Asia (CNA)
Today Online
Singapore Ministry of Health (MOH) Newsroom
AI should factor in current season and weather conditions in Singapore when giving recommendations (e.g., haze season precautions, monsoon season cold/flu risks, high-heat hydration advice).
Weather and seasonal awareness should be dynamically updated using live data from a reliable weather API (e.g., NEA Weather API).
5. File & Data Handling
Add a file upload option in the chat UI so users can attach PDFs, images, or medical records.
AI should parse these files, extract relevant health data, and add it to the patient’s stored medical history for context in future conversations.
Display uploaded file names in the chat for reference.
6. Health Plan Logic & Interactions
Schedule 1 full diagnostic test panel every 3 months (track this in the conversation).
Assume:
Member starts ~5 user-initiated chats per week.
5 hrs/week spent on health plan.
Exercises updated every 2 weeks based on progress.
Travels 1 week every 4 weeks.
Lives in Singapore.
Follows plan ~50% of the time (AI must adapt plan accordingly).
When generating health plan updates, highlight only key issues or tracked metrics in plain text.
7. Chat UI Requirements
User messages: aligned to right, distinct background color (like ChatGPT).
Bot messages: aligned to left, distinct background color, include specialist name & role at the start. Example:
Dr. Warren (Medical Strategist): Based on your test results, I recommend…
File upload button visible in chat area.
Auto-scroll to newest message.
Mobile-friendly & clean layout.
8. Behavior
AI must adapt responses dynamically to the patient’s history, ongoing health trends in Singapore, and latest local weather conditions.
Responses should be conversational but authoritative, matching each specialist’s tone.
AI must always provide reasoning and cite sources.
